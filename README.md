# Software-Test-Automation-QA-Project-One
In this project, I developed a mobile application for a client as a software engineer at Grand Strand Systems. The application includes contact, task, and appointment services with corresponding unit tests. The ContactService allows adding, deleting, and updating contact objects. The TaskService enables similar operations for tasks. The AppointmentService handles appointments with features for addition, deletion, and field updates. The project utilized in-memory data structures and met all requirements, delivering a tested and functional mobile application.
